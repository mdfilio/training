There's three main ways to install nginx:
	OS repo
	nginx repo
	source

We 






Versions:
	mainline
	stable
	legacy


	mainline is actively being developed, and gets new features and bug fixes, but may also introduce bugs,
	    or change the way the API works so third party modules may stop working as expected. Despite this it
	    is still recommended for production by the nginx developers. 

	stable has critical bug fixes backported from mainline, but is mainly feature static.
	
	legacy no updates.
