The Web and Nginx for Linux SysAds

Michael Filio


II. What's in this training and why?
   
   Why?
   * Lots of new admins without a fundamental background in the internet and webhosting technologies.
   * Increasing market share of Nginx is making it more important to know.
        From Jan to Oct 2015 14% - 16% or 128mil to 146mil (Netcraft)
   
   What?
   * Basic Internet and networking architecture.
   * Provide some insight into web application architecture for sysadmins with no developer experience.
   * Cover the fundamental differences between Nginx and Apache.
   * Provide an introduction to Nginx and provide resources for more information.
   * Basic system tuning including kernel tunables and file systems.

   Part II will be labs, with Nginx configuration.

III. Networking

Without Networking there is no Internet or web sites.

You should know some basic vocabulary about networking and how it functions. 
Particularly the OSI and TCP/IP models.

Not going to go into too much depth on the models, but this diagram is great.

IV. Protocols

	IP/ICMP - Networking (Layer 3)
	TCP/UDP - Transport (Layer 4)
	DNS/HTTP - Application (Layer 7)

If there are problems with any of these you don't get your webpage.

V. DNS

   * /etc/nsswitch.conf - Name Service Switch
     hosts: files dns

   * /etc/hosts

   * /etc/resolv.conf

   Server -> Name Server
      Cached - returns record 
         ROOT server returns TLD
         Request the NS from TLD
         Then finally request against the NS for domain
      returns record

   There's a cost for DNS lookups, and also you always want to know you're connecting to
   the right server.


VI. TCP

As HTTP sits on top of TCP a brief mention here is needed.

TCP as a protocol uses connections that does error handling to make sure data arrives correctly.

As part of this process, it establishes a connection with the '3 way handshake'

Opening: 

Client -> SYN (Synchronize) -> Server
Client <- SYN / ACK (Acknowledge) <- Server
Client -> ACK -> Server

These connections are expensive and add a round trip time (RTT) to the total time (a ping) for each connection so the recommendation is usally to enable keep alives. Is this correct? Depends on your site. Can lead to slower load times with keep alive on.

After the connection is open the HTTP traffic is sent.

Client -> HTTP Request -> Server
Client <- HTTP Response <- Server

In progress:

ESTABLISHED

Closing 

Server -> FIN/ACK -> Client
Server <- ACK <- Client
Server <- FIN/ACK <- Client
Server -> ACK -> Client

TIME_WAIT (Linux has a hardcoded value for 60 seconds)
The OS keeps the connection locally to prevent reusing it and getting errant packets from a previous TCP session.

So what's wrong with your netstat one liners?

VII. HTTP

HTTP protocols
HTTP 1.0 May 1996
HTTP 1.1 last update June 1999
  One request per TCP connection
  * HTTP pipelining - not practical. Returned requests in order and browsers have it off.
  * Client browsers just use mutliple connections instead (6)
     * Domain sharding - different subdomains so more connections made,  previous recommendation is not to use more than 2.
     * Concatenation - Combine resources (CSS, JS, images) into a single larger resource
        Cons
           - poor cache utilization - one update means entire resource needs to be refreshed
           - delays - must download entire resource before any part of it can be used
     * Inlining - embed directly inside HTML
        Cons
           - duplication - has to be inlined everywhere it is used

HTTP 2 is here and coming soon. as of nginx 1.9.5 supports it. Current mainline is now 1.9.6 as of 10/27.


VIII. HTTP 2

HTTP 2
   Based on SPDY developed by Google since 2009
   Multiple requests over single TCP connection
   Out of order completion
   Headers no longer plain text but in binary format
   Request Prioritization
      * can weight content and assign dependencies
   Server Push
      * Server can push resources before client requests it
   Header Compression
        HPACK - protocol for encoding the binary headers - https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/compression.html
   Mandatory SSL - RFC does not mandate it, but chrome and firefox will only support http2 with ssl
      * google does give higher rankings to sites that are encrypted


      *** It is not backwards compatible with 1.1
          Negotiation - ALPN (OpenSSL 1.0.2)
                      - NPN (OpenSSL 1.0.1)

    
IX. HTTP 2 as it is in nginx

    1.9.5 is built against 1.0.1 OpenSSL.
    Only built for incoming connections, not backend, also only with ssl enabled. 
    No server push yet.
    Likely have 15 - 20% gain over just https.
    Streaming doesn't work well over ssl and so no real performance gains if that's your model.

    Other implications:
    	RHEL7 is still on 1.0.1 for OpenSSL, curl is 7.29, support for http2 not until 7.36.0, etc.


X. Web Server processing
   
XI. Browser rendering


XII. End of web infrastructure slide. 

Tying it all together...

What happens when you make a browser request 

1) URL in browser
2) DNS
3) Establish TCP connection and get initial html
4) Make additional requests for items on page (6 on current versions of firefox and chrome)
5) Webserver processing
6) Browser rendering
